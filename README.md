<h1>Project 1: Expense Reimbursement System</h1>

<h2>Project Description:</h2>

A web portal where users can request tickets for expense reimbursements, and managers can approve or deny these tickets.

<h3>Technologies Used:</h3>

* Java
* JBDC
* Tomcat Servers
* HTML

<h3>Features:</h3>

Users can log in with their credentials on the login page. If they are a user, they were be redirected to a page where they can request a ticket after specifying the details of the ticker.
Users can also view their past tickets while sorting them based on status. If the user is also identified as a manager in the databse, they will be able to view all tickets regardless of user.
Managers can choose to deny or approve requests, and can sort tickets in a similar fashion to how normal users can.
